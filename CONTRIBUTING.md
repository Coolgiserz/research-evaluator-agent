## 2. Development Setup

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub.
2. **Clone** your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Coolgiserz/research-evaluator-agent.git
   cd research-evaluator-agent
   ```
3. **Create** and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
4. **Install** the UV dependency manager (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install uv
   ```
5. **Sync** project dependencies from `pyproject.toml`/`uv.lock`:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```
6. **Create** a new branch for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```

## 3. Code Style and Quality

- Follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for Python code.
- Format code with **Black**:
  ```bash
  black .
  ```
- Sort imports with **isort**:
  ```bash
  isort .
  ```
- (Optional) Check lint issues with **flake8**:
  ```bash
  flake8 .
  ```

Ensure all code passes formatting and lint checks before committing.

## 4. Writing Tests

- The project uses **pytest** and **pytest-asyncio**.
- Add or update tests under the `tests/` directory for new features or bug fixes.
- Run tests locally:
  ```bash
  pytest --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings -q
  ```
- Aim for good coverage and cover edge cases.
